# Supportability Statement
 
SUSE provides support for software appliances (images) built by SUSE Studio
using the templates provided therein for SUSE Linux Enterprise products.
Support will be provided if and only if subscriptions are purchased for the
total number of units of the SUSE Linux Enterprise product deployed,
installed or used within the resulting appliances ("units" of the SUSE
Linux Enterprise product is defined by SUSE in the applicable subscription
offering).
To buy subscriptions and support for SUSE Linux Enterprise products,
go to the [SUSE Webshop] or request a call from our webpage.
More information about SUSE Linux Enterprise is available [online][SLES].

## Supportability Report

SUSE Studio creates a "Supportability Report" for each SUSE Linux
Enterprise appliance.
This report executes an automatic analysis of the generated appliance and uses
heuristics to determine out what SUSE will support.
The Supportability Report should be viewed as a tool to highlight potential
deviations from the support conditions outlined below.
SUSE reserves for itself the right to make a final determination on the
supportability of the software appliance.
If the following conditions are not met, SUSE will not support your appliance:

### Support Information and Conditions

* For each unit of SUSE Linux Enterprise product(s) you deploy, install
  or use, you require a valid support contract ("units" of the SUSE Linux
  Enterprise product is defined by SUSE in the applicable subscription
  offering).
  The terms and conditions of the respective support contract apply in addition
  to the terms of this document.
  In case of a conflict between these terms and the terms of the respective
  support contract, the terms of the respective support contract shall take
  precedence.
* In general, changes to configuration files and additions of new software
  are supported as if you created the image with an installation using YaST.
* SUSE supports packages according to the support level in the underlying
  SUSE Linux Enterprise products.
  For details about support exceptions, please consult the [release notes].
* Packages that are part of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit
  are not supported, unless they are also part of the underlying
  SUSE Linux Enterprise product.
* Replacing or removing key software components (packages) might render your
  appliance unsupportable by SUSE.
* Replacing an existing SUSE package with a self-built or third-party package
  will render all SUSE packages which depend in any way on that self-built
  or third-party package unsupported by SUSE.
* In case of opening a support request, Novell Technical Services (NTS) might
  request installation of additional tools necessary to assist and accelerate
  further analysis.

## Changes to these terms

SUSE reserves the right to update and change these terms from time to time
without notice.
Continued use of the service after any such changes shall constitute your
consent to such changes.
You can review the most [current version] of the terms at any time.
