# Using appliances

SUSE Studio appliances can be used in many ways, depending on the formats
chosen. Some formats can be copied to hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, and DVDs.
Other formats are intended to be run inside of virtual machines or cloud systems.

If you are looking for a way to quickly and easily run Linux on your
computer, we suggest building a Live CD / DVD or a VMDK (VMware / VirtualBox)
appliance. Both of these formats can be used to run a SUSE-based Linux operating
system while preserving the existing software on your computer. A live disc
boots on an actual computer (from the DVD drive) while virtualization formats
(such as VMDK) are similar to running a software-based computer inside of a
computer.


When the file has been downloaded, most desktop environments (Gnome, KDE, and
Mac OS X) provide a way to uncompress the archive by right-clicking the file (in
the file manager) and selecting an "Extract here" option.

Those using a terminal to extract files can use programs such as '''gunzip'''
and '''tar'''.
