SUSE Studio supports the creation of custom bootable CDs and DVDs. 
These discs can support installation from the live media to the hard drive as
well.

Most operating systems make disc burning easy. Once the file has been downloaded
completely, simply right-click on the file and select something like *burn ISO
file to disc*.
