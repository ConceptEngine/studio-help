# Running Appliances on VMware

The downloaded file has the suffix *.vmx.tar.gz*. After extraction you
will see a new subdirectory with two files with the suffixes *.vmdk* and
*.vmx*

VMware Player is needed to start using this appliance format.
[Download it from VMware's website](http://www.vmware.com/download/player/).
Once installed, the .vmx file should be associated and your appliance
will start with a double-click.
