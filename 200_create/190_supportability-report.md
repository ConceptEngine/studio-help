# Viewing the Supportability Report

SUSE Studio can analyze each package in your SUSE Linux Enterprise
appliances and determine if your appliance is supported, and if there
are any exceptions to supporting an appliance.

On the *Build* tab, each build of a SUSE Linux Enterprise appliance
includes a link to "View supportability report...".

The report opens in a new window and contains a summary of each format
of your appliance. You can view:

* With *full supportability report* it lists each package in your appliance and its license. 
* With the *X licenses* link it gives you a list of all used licenses in your appliance. 
* The *Y total packages* link shows a list of packages and their versions.

If you want an overview of all licenses in your appliance, use `zypper licenses`
