# Viewing the Supportability Report

SUSE Studio can analyze each package in your SUSE Linux Enterprise
appliances and determine if an appliance is supported, or if there
are exceptions to supporting an appliance.

On the *Build* tab, each build of a SUSE Linux Enterprise appliance
includes a link to "View supportability report...".

The report opens in a new window and contains a summary of each format
of your appliance:

* The *full supportability report* provides a list of all packages in your appliance and their licenses. 
* The *X licenses* link gives you a list of all licenses used in your appliance. 
* The *Y total packages* link shows a list of packages and their versions.

If you want an overview of all licenses in your appliance, use `zypper licenses`
