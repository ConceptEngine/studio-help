# Your Home Page

If you have already created an appliance, SUSE Studio lists your appliances, grouped by access rights (your private appliances, your gallery appliances, and appliances other users have shared with you.)

![Studio Home - Your appliances](studio-home-online.png)

From here, you can:

* **Create a New Appliance.** Click "Create new appliance..." and choose a base template, like you did for you first appliance.
* **Manage Your Cloud Deployments** Upload your EC2- or Azure-formatted images, and manage your uploaded images.  See [Use > Amazon Ec2](../use/amazon-ec2.html) and [Use > Windows Azure](../use/windows-azure.html) for details.
* **Work on Existing Appliances.** Click an entry on the appliances lists to work with a saved appliance. To use a previously saved appliance as a base template, mouse over it and click "Clone" to create a new appliance based on the currently selected one.
* **Clone Shared Appliances.** If another user has shared an appliance with you, you may clone it, starting a new appliance based on it. You cannot modify an appliance that is shared with you.
