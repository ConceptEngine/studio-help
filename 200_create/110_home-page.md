# Your Home Page

After you log in to SUSE Studio for the first time, you need to select one of the available base templates upon which to build your first appliance. A base template determines the operating system your appliance is based upon, which packages will be initially selected, and the processor architecture.

If you have already created an appliance, SUSE Studio lists your appliances, grouped by access rights (your private appliances, your gallery appliances, and appliances other users have shared with you.)

From here, you can:

* **Create a New Appliance.** Click "Create new appliance..." and choose a base template, like you did for you first appliance.
* **Manage Your Cloud Deployments** Upload your EC2- or Azure-formatted images, and manage your uploaded images.  See [Use > Amazon Ec2](../use/amazon-ec2.html) and [Use > Windows Azure](../use/windows-azure.html) for details.
* **Work on Existing Appliances.** Click an entry on the appliances lists to work with a saved appliance. To use a previously saved appliance as a base template, mouse over it and click "Clone" to create a new appliance based on the currently selected one.
* **Clone Shared Appliances.** If another user has shared an appliance with you, you may clone it, starting a new appliance based on it. You cannot modify an appliance that is shared with you.
