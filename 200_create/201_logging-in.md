# Logging In

Before you can use SUSE Studio decide where to log in:

If you want to use the official SUSE Studio website from [http://susestudio.com][susestudio], use your login credentials from Novell, Google, or Yahoo. It is also possible to use an openID account from any openID provider.
If you do not have a SUSE Studio account yet, get an invitation by providing your e-mail address. It usually takes some time before your request is being processed.
If you still need help, click the link [Need help signing in?][signin-help] to get detailed information.
