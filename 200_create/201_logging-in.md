# Logging In

Before you can use SUSE Studio decide where to log in:

If you want to use the official SUSE Studio website from
[http://susestudio.com][susestudio], use your login credentials from Novell,
Google, or Yahoo. It is also possible to use an [OpenID][openid] account from
any OpenID provider.

When logging in for the first time your SUSE Studio account will be created.
Note that the SUSE Studio account is tied to the way you log in. So if you log
in with a different login provider, you'll have a different account on SUSE
Studio. It is possible to merge your accounts on your user page in SUSE Studio.

If you still need help, click the link [Need help signing in?][signin-help] to
get detailed information.
