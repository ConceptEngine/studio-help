# Viewing the Supportability Report

If you have a support contract with Novell, you need to know whether your appliance is supported or not. SUSE Studio can analyze each package in your appliance and determine any possible conflicting changes to your support contract.

Go to the *Build* page. If you have successfully built your appliance, SUSE Studio displays the report with the *View supportability report...* link. The report is viewed in a new window and contains a summary of each format of your appliance. With *full supportability report* it lists each package in your appliance.
