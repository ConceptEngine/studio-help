# Exporting KIWI Configuration

SUSE Studio uses KIWI as back-end to build its appliances. KIWI is a image build
system which is designed to provide a complete operating system image. It
supports both hardware platforms as well as virtualization systems.

Usually SUSE Studio provides everything what you need to build your appliances.
Experienced users can manually intervene in the build process in case of special
needs. For this reason, SUSE Studio offers to export your appliance's
configuration which can be used by KIWI.

To export your appliance's configuration, click the Build tab, scroll down and
select Export your appliance's Kiwi configuration. Download the archive, extract
it and run it as explained in KIWI's User Guide. Find more information on KIWI's
homepage at http://kiwi.berlios.de.
