# Building Appliances

Each appliance, independently of the format, is given a version number in the format `major.minor.release`. It is recommended to use the following scheme for version numbering:

* Increment the release number, if there are no software related changes.
* Update the minor number, and change release to 0, if you add or remove any packages.
* Update the major number, and change minor and release to 0, when you have done substantial modifications to your appliance.

To build your appliance, proceed as follows:

1. Click the *Build* link.

2. Select your default format.

3. If needed, select additional formats.

4. Insert the version number of your appliance.

5. Check the messages for tips and errors on the left side. If your appliance has to fit on a CD (700 MB limit) you have to deselect some software under the *Software* link.

6. Click the Build button to start the creation process. Depending on the number of packages this takes some time.

7. Download your appliance or start the testdrive (see Chapter 3, Testing Appliances).
