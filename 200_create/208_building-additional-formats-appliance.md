# Building Additional Formats of an Appliance

It is possible to build additional formats after having built your default
format already. Proceed as follows:

1. Build your appliance the usual way as described in section ["Building
Appliances"][building-appliances]. You should end up with an appliance format
with a specific version.

2. From the *Additional formats area* check all formats you want to build. If
you select one entry, the Build *additional* button appears on each built
appliances.

3. Press the *Build additional* button on the respective appliance version to
start the build process. The build process takes over and needs a while to
finish.
