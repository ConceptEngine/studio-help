## What is a software appliance?

A software appliance is a pre-configured combination of:

* an operating system (e.g. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server)
* applications (e.g. a database, web browser)
* configuration

The parts are integrated into a single image and deployable on industry
standard hardware.

If it is intended for deployment on a server, it is a software
appliance. If it is intended for deployment on a hypervisor or in a
cloud computing environment, it is a special type of software appliance
called a virtual appliance.

## What are the benefits of appliances?

There are many advantages of using appliances over traditional software
deployment methods, such as:

* ease of use/deploy
* smaller size
* having a well defined software selection and configuration
* customized to fit perfectly within a specific environment
* ease of maintenance and updates

## Isn't it difficult to create appliances?

No, it's quite simple! The SUSE Studio team designs and implements the
entire site with the goal of making it easy.

After your first sign in you will not have an appliance. From your home
page, you can create a new appliance and select a template to create
your own custom appliance.


## You can navigate the appliance editor by switching tabs

**Software:** Add/Remove packages and repositories (you will have access
to the openSUSE build service) or upload your own rpms.

**Configure:** Configure locale settings, startup options, database use,
storage management and other things like the look and feel via logo and
wallpaper

**Overlay files:** Add "overlay files" to fine tune the application and
system configuration

**Build:** Start the build run to create
+ a Disk Image
+ a LiveCD/DVD
+ a VMware Image
+ or a Xen Image 

**Testdrive:** If the build is finished, launch and interact with your
creation in a virtual machine in your browser window, make changes and
commit those changes to the appliance. To do this, use the Modified
files tab in the testdrive.
Then implement your changes via a new build run and download the
resulting image via the Build tab.


## Where can I find maintenance times of SUSE Studio?

Maintenance times are published at
[http://susestudio.com/maintenance_times](http://susestudio.com/maintenance_times "SUSE Studio Maintenance Times").
This list will be updated continuously.
During maintenance time new updates and bugfixes will be deployed to
[SUSE Studio](http://susestudio.com/ "SUSE Studio").
Most of the times you will still be able to access our service and edit
your appliance, but starting new builds or running testdrive for your
appliance will be disabled.

In rare cases you might not be able to access SUSE Studio during these
times.


## Where is the official documentation?

The official documentation can be found on the [SUSE Studio
help](http://susestudio.com/help "SUSE Studio Help") page.


## What do I need to login?

You need a valid Novell, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter or OpenID-account, and a valid
email address.


## Where can I see changes of the Studio functionality?

Please follow our [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/susestudio/), 
[Blog](http://blog.susestudio.com/),
or [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/susestudio).

## How can I build a standard image (like JeOS or Server)?

When you create a new appliance, you will be starting from a predefined template, 
based on openSUSE 12.2, SLE11 SP2 or SLE10 SP4 for 32 and 64-bit x86 systems.
They are all working out of the box without any changes, or you can download images
from other users in Gallery.


## Where and how can I report bugs?

Please send us your problem via the feedback link (the speech bubble
shown on the top left in the appliance editor or your home page).


## How can I upload custom RPMs?

Under tab "Software" &rarr; "Upload RPMs" you can upload local saved
RPMs or packages from the web. They must have the format .rpm or
archives of RPMs in .tar, .tar.gz, .tgz, .tar.bz2, .tbz or .zip format.


## What appliance formats are available?

At the moment you can create images for USB stick / hard disk, Live
CD/DVD, VMWare / Virtual Box / KVM, OVF virtual machine, XEN guest, Hyper-V and
Preload ISO, or target public clouds, including Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure.


## How can I publish an appliance?

After creating an working appliance, go to the "Share"-tab, add a
description what your appliance does and tags for easier finding. Save
your changes and select a version which you want to publish and press
add. Now everybody can find your appliance on SUSE Gallery.


## How can I unpublish an appliance?

Open susestudio.com, go to the "Home" screen. Then select your appliance
and click on the "Share" tab. In the "Share with everyone" section
select the version you want to unpublish and click the "Unpublish"
button.


## What is a "Overlay File"?

It's a file that will overwrite existing files. In Studio it is under
"Files".


## Does SLES images exported to EC2 fall under the terms and conditions from http://aws.amazon.com/suse/  or under the Linux/Unix usage from http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/ ?

Under the former
([http://aws.amazon.com/suse/](http://aws.amazon.com/suse/)), hence you
get full access to updates, albeit with a slight price premium.


## I'm looking to export my OpenSUSE-based appliance to EC2 as a micro instance, but the deployer disallows it. How can I get it working?

Amazon provides the micro instance type for EBS backed AMIs only.

The create_ami.sh script included with Studio-built openSUSE images
currently creates only S3 backed AMIs.

Meanwhile, you can try tweaking the create_ebs_ami.sh script for SLES
based EC2 images to work with your openSUSE based image.


## Can I link to my appliance on other websites?

Sure, we really appreciate and recommend that. The link to the public
appliance page is permanent and can safely be used for linking.


## How can I get my appliance to become an official openSUSE product like openSUSE Medical?
