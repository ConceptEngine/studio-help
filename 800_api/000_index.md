# SUSE Studio API

## RESTful API

SUSE Studio features a RESTful API over HTTP, which can be used to clone
appliances, upload files, trigger and monitor builds, and more. See the SUSE
[Studio API documentation][studio-api] for more details.

## Authentication

To use the API you have to create an API key, which will be used as the
password for HTTP Basic Authentication. This can be done on [the user page
within SUSE Studio][studio-api-key].
