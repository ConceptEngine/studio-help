# Contributing to SUSE Studio Online Help

We greatly appreciate contributions to the online help of SUSE Studio. So if
you see something, which is missing or not accurate or not complete, please let
us know, or even better fix it yourself and send us your changes via a pull
request.

For reporting issues you can use the GitHub issues on the studio-help project.

If you want to contribute content, be it small fixes or bigger pieces covering
areas of SUSE Studio, which aren't described in the help yet, you can easily do
it. Just create a pull request with the changes. One way how to do it is
described in our blog:

We have a simple review process for all changes to the online help. Every change
has to be done with a pull request and somebody else than the contributor has
to review it. Once the reviewer says ok, the request can be merged.

Changes merged to the master branch are automatically deployed to the online
help on our production system at
