# How to contribute

Our goal is to provide great online documentation for SUSE Studio. While
we do our best, we realize that there are many smart people out there
who can document just as well as we do. So we want to make it as easy as
possible for you to contribute. Your help is much appreciated.

To contribute to the SUSE Studio Online documentation just fork the
[SUSE Studio Help](http://github.com/susestudio/studio-help) repository
on Github, add your changes, and send us a merge request. A walkthrough
of this process can be found on our blog: [Contributing to the SUSE Studio online help](http://blog.susestudio.com/2012/11/contributing-to-suse-studio-online-help.html).
