<h1 id="configuringappliances">Configuring Appliances</h1>

<p>Use the <em>Configuration</em> link on the SUSE Studio Web page to control several aspects about your appliances:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong>
Change your default locale and timezone, configure your network, enable your firewall, and add users and groups.</p>

<p><strong>Personalize</strong>
Add new logo and background for your appliance.</p>

<p><strong>Start-Up</strong>
Define your default runlevel and any end user licence agreement. Usually this is empty, but if you choose it, the user has to agree to your licences the first time he uses your appliance.</p>

<p><strong>Server</strong>
Set up a PostgreSQL or MySQL database configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Desktop</strong>
Configure automatic login for users and any program which is automatically started during login.</p>

<p><strong>Appliance</strong>
Set up advanced configuration for your appliance like disk, memory, and logical volume manager. Usually for the experts.</p>

<p><strong>Scripts</strong>
Run custom scripts at the end of your build. Usually for experts only.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to change the logo or the background of your appliance, go to <em>Configuration+Personalize</em>. Select from pre-defined logos or upload your own. Do the same for changing the background. See an overview of how your appliance will look like during boot and login in the Preview section.</p>
