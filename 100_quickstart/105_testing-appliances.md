# Testing Appliances

SUSE Studio's testdrive allows testing your appliance without downloading it. After having built your appliance, choose from these methods:

1. Use the browser.
2. Use a VNC session.
3. Log in with SSH.

Click the *Build* tab and select *Testdrive* from your built appliance. A new window opens in your browser. Your appliance boots automatically and displays your login screen. If you want to use a VNC session or log in with SSH, click on *Networking*: off. This page displays some explanations how to use these methods.
