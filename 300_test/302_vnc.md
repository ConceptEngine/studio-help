# Using a VNC Session

If you want to use VNC instead of the browser, proceed as follows:

1. If you use a firewall, make sure the following outgoing ports are open:

       5900:5910/TCP - VNC
       843/TCP
       
  More about firewalls can be found in the [Security Guide].

2. Build your appliance as described in section ["Creating
Appliances"][create].

3. Click *Testdrive* to start the session.

4. Click the *Networking: off* link at the top of the Web page.

5. Enter the following command in a shell to start the VNC session and
   replace *NODE* with the name of your SUSE Studio server:

       vncviewer -encodings 'zlib hextile copyrect' NODE

6. Enter the password. Find it on the Web page, described in Step 4.
   After you have entered the correct password, a window opens.

7. Work with your appliance.
