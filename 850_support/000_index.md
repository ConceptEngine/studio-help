# Support

We want you to have a great experience on our site. We try hard to make things
work out of the box. When this doesn't work we are here to support you.

The first source of support is our [online help]. There you also find answers
on [frequently asked questions].

If you would like to get in contact with other users to ask them for help, try
our [online forum].

We love to hear your [feedback], and will also try to answer your questions.

If you are a customer of the onsite version of [SUSE Studio][onsite], you can
also use your SUSE support channels.

While we try our best to support a broad variety of use cases, there are some
limitations. Have a look at our [browser support policy] to see which browsers
we support.

We hope that helps and you enjoy using SUSE Studio.
