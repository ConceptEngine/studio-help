## What is a software appliance?

A software appliance is a pre-configured combination of:

* an operating system (e.g. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server)
* applications (e.g. a database, web browser)
* configuration

The parts are integrated into a single image and deployable on industry
standard hardware.

If it is intended for deployment on a server, it is a software
appliance. If it is intended for deployment on a hypervisor or in a
cloud computing environment, it is a special type of software appliance
called a virtual appliance.
