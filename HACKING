<!-- vim: set ft=markdown tw=72 sw=2 sts=2 et: -->

* keep text width of prose under 72 chars
* start sentences on separate lines, even within a paragraph.
  this keeps diffs readable as there's no need to reflow the rest
  of a paragraph after a (even small) change.
* keep enumerations (definition lists etc) sorted (LC_ALL=C)
